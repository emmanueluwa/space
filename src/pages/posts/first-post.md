Eth-proof of stake

- Reduces environmental impact by up to 99%.
- Proof of work uses up a lot of computer energy and this is not sustainable or environmentally friendly.
- Proof of work proposes using coins locked into the mechanism as control of the ability to participate on the eth network, this is a lot less energy consuming than relying on the ability find solutions to difficult hash challenges (this is what proof of work is, using the correct solution as proof of authenticity on the network)
- Some will argue that this gives a greater advantage to those who are more financially stable and as a result less decentralised, the founder of eth argues this is the case with proof of work whilst being bad for the environment.
- Nodes put up collateral as a sybil resistance mechanism. Ethereum is used as stake that users of the blockchain will behave honestly in the network – misbehaving = loosing stake (Ethereum) – miners = validators in proof of stake, validating randomly chosen nodes.

Scalability

- Gas fees increase when there is a lot of active blockchain users – there is not always enough block space for transactions – this is not scalable.

Sharding, eth 2.0 (A solution to scalability issues)

- Sharding was welcomed in eth 2.0 this means that every participant in a network downloads and verifies a small portion of all the transactions. The portions are known as shards. This will improve scalability and capacity. Keeping hardware requirements low makes it easier to run a node.
- A blockchain of blockchains – more chains run by one main chain will lead to more space.

Blockchain layers

- Layer 1 - Base layer - blockchain implementation such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.
- Layer 2 – applications added or built on top of the blockchain, an example of this is chainlink https://chain.link/
